# GTFS Realtime Validator

In April 2022, CUTR at USF [partnered with MobilityData](https://mobilitydata.org/mobilitydata-and-usf-partner-to-improve-real-time-transit-information/) to maintain and further improve the GTFS Realtime Validator as a community resource.

The latest software development is happening on the [MobilityData gtfs-realtime-validator repository](https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-realtime-validator).

See you there! :bus: :railway_car: :light_rail:
