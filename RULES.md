### E001 - Not in POSIX time

All times and timestamps must be in [POSIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (i.e., number of **seconds** since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC).

*Common mistakes* - Accidentally using Java's `System.currentTimeMillis()`, which is the number of **milliseconds** since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  

*Possible solution* - Use `TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toSeconds(System.currentTimeMillis())` to convert from milliseconds to seconds.

### E002 - `stop_time_updates` not strictly sorted

`stop_time_updates` for a given `trip_id` must be strictly ordered by increasing `stop_sequence` - this also means that no `stop_sequence` should be repeated. 

From [Stop Time Updates description](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates):

>Updates should be sorted by stop_sequence (or stop_ids in the order they occur in the trip).

From [GTFS `stop_times.txt`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#stop_timestxt):

>The values for stop_sequence must be non-negative integers, and they must increase along the trip.

This validation rule is implemented for both when `stop_sequence` is provided in the GTFS-rt feed, and when `stop_sequence` is omitted from the GTFS-rt feed.

*Common mistakes* - Assuming that the GTFS `stop_times.txt` file will be grouped by `trip_id` and sorted by `stop_sequence` - while sorting the data is a good practice, it's not strictly required by the spec.   

*Possible solution* - Group the GTFS `stop_times.txt` records by `trip_id` and sort by `stop_sequence`.  Also, make sure that no `stop_sequence` is repeated in GTFS `stop_times.txt`.

### E003 - GTFS-rt `trip_id` does not exist in GTFS data

All `trip_ids` provided in the GTFS-rt feed must exist in the GTFS data, unless their `schedule_relationship` is set to `ADDED`.

[`trip`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor) says:

>`trip_id` - The trip_id from the GTFS feed that this selector refers to.

[`schedule_relationship`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship-1) says:

>If a trip is done in accordance with temporary schedule, not reflected in GTFS, then it shouldn't be marked as SCHEDULED, but marked as ADDED...
>
>`ADDED` - An extra trip that was added in addition to a running schedule, for example, to replace a broken vehicle or to respond to sudden passenger load.

### E004 - GTFS-rt `route_id` does not exist in GTFS data

All `route_ids` provided in the GTFS-rt feed must exist in the GTFS data.

[`trip`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor) says:

>`route_id` - The route_id from the GTFS that this selector refers to.

<a name="E006"/>

### E006 - Missing required trip field for frequency-based exact_times = 0

Frequency-based `exact_times` = 0 `trip_updates` must contain `trip_id`, `start_time`, and `start_date`.

#### References:
* [`trip_update.trip`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#systems-with-repeated-trip_ids)

<a name="E009"/>

### E009 - GTFS-rt `stop_sequence` isn't provided for `trip` that visits same `stop_id` more than once

If a GTFS `trip` contains multiple references to the same `stop_id` (i.e., the vehicle visits the same `stop_id` more than once in the same trip), then GTFS-rt `stop_time_updates` for this trip must include `stop_sequence`.

From [`stop_time_update`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-stoptimeupdate):

>If the same stop_id is visited more than once in a trip, then stop_sequence should be provided in all StopTimeUpdates for that stop_id on that trip.

### E010 - `location_type` not `0` in stops.txt

(Note that this is implemented but not executed because it's specific to GTFS - see [issue #126](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/issues/126)

If location_type is used in `stops.txt`, all stops referenced in `stop_times.txt` must have `location_type` of `0`

<a name="E011"/>

### E011 - GTFS-rt `stop_id` does not exist in GTFS data

All `stop_ids` referenced in GTFS-rt feeds must exist in the GTFS data in `stops.txt`.

From [`stop_time_update`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-stoptimeupdate)):

>`stop_id` - Must be the same as in stops.txt in the corresponding GTFS feed.

From [`position`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-vehicleposition):

>`stop_id` - Identifies the current stop. The value must be the same as in stops.txt in the corresponding GTFS feed.

<a name="E012"/>

### E012 - Header `timestamp` should be greater than or equal to all other timestamps

No timestamps for individual entities (TripUpdate, VehiclePosition, Alerts) in the feeds should be greater than the header timestamp.

From [`header`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-feedheader):

>`timestamp` - This timestamp identifies the moment when the content of this feed has been created (in server time). In POSIX time (i.e., number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC). To avoid time skew between systems producing and consuming realtime information it is strongly advised to derive timestamp from a time server. It is completely acceptable to use Stratum 3 or even lower strata servers since time differences up to a couple of seconds are tolerable.

### E013 - Frequency type 0 trip `schedule_relationship` should be `UNSCHEDULED` or empty

For frequency-based exact_times=0 trips, schedule_relationship should be `UNSCHEDULED` or empty.

From [Trip Updates -> Trip Descriptor description](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#trip-descriptor):

>`UNSCHEDULED` - This trip is running and is never associated with a schedule. For example, if there is no schedule and the buses run on a shuttle service.

From [`trip_update.trip.schedule_relationship`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship-1):

>`UNSCHEDULED` - A trip that is running with no schedule associated to it, for example, if there is no schedule at all.

### E015 - All `stop_ids` referenced in GTFS-rt feeds must have the `location_type` = 0

All `stop_ids` referenced in GTFS-rt feeds must have the `location_type` = 0 in GTFS `stops.txt`.

From [GTFS `stop_times.txt`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#stop_timestxt):

>`stop_id` - ...The stop_id is referenced from the stops.txt file. If location_type is used in stops.txt, all stops referenced in stop_times.txt must have location_type of 0.

### E016 - `trip_ids` with `schedule_relationship` `ADDED` must not be in GTFS data

Trips that have a `schedule_relationship` of `ADDED` must **NOT** be included in the GTFS data.

From [`trip.schedule_relationship`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship-1):

>`ADDED` - An extra trip that was added in addition to a running schedule, for example, to replace a broken vehicle or to respond to sudden passenger load.

From [Trip Updates -> Trip Descriptor description](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#trip-descriptor):

>Added - This trip was not scheduled and has been added. For example, to cope with demand, or replace a broken down vehicle.

### E017 - GTFS-rt content changed but has the same header `timestamp`

The GTFS-rt header `timestamp` value should always change if the feed contents change - the feed contents must not change without updating the header `timestamp`.

*Common mistakes* - If there are multiple instances of GTFS-realtime feed behind a load balancer, each instance may be pulling information from the real-time data source and publishing it to consumers slightly out of sync.  If a GTFS-rt consumer makes two back-to-back requests, and each request is served by a different GTFS-rt feed instance, the same feed contents could potentially be returned to the consumer with different timestamps. 

*Possible solution* - Configure the load balancer for "sticky routes", so that the consumer always receives the GTFS-rt feed contents from the same GTFS-rt instance.

<a name="E018"/>

### E018 - GTFS-rt header `timestamp` decreased between two sequential iterations

The GTFS-rt header `timestamp` should be monotonically increasing -  it should always be the same value or greater than previous feed iterations if the feed contents are different.

*Common mistakes* - If there are multiple instances of GTFS-realtime feed behind a load balancer, each instance may be pulling information from the real-time data source and publishing it to consumers slightly out of sync.  If a GTFS-rt consumer makes two back-to-back requests, and each request is served by a different GTFS-rt feed instance, the same feed contents could potentially be returned to the consumer with the most recent feed response having a timestamp that is less than the previous feed response.

*Possible solution* - Configure the load balancer for "sticky routes", so that the GTFS-rt consumer always receives the GTFS-rt feed contents from the same GTFS-rt instance.

### E019 - GTFS-rt frequency type 1 trip `start_time` must be a multiple of GTFS data `start_time`

For frequency-based trips defined in `frequencies.txt` with `exact_times` = 1, the GTFS-rt trip `start_time` must be some multiple (including zero) of `headway_secs` later than the `start_time` in file `frequencies.txt` for the corresponding time period.  Note that this doesn't not apply to frequency-based trips defined in `frequencies.txt` with `exact_times` = 0.

From [`trip.start_time`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor):

>`start_time` - ...If the trip corresponds to exact_times=1 GTFS record, then start_time must be some multiple (including zero) of headway_secs later than frequencies.txt start_time for the corresponding time period.

### E020 - Invalid `start_time` format

`start_time` must be in the format `25:15:35`.  Note that times can exceed 24 hrs if service goes into the next service day.

From [`trip.start_time`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor):

### E021 - Invalid `start_date` format

`start_date` must be in the `YYYYMMDD` format.

From [`trip.start_date`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor):

>`start_date` - The scheduled start date of this trip instance...In YYYYMMDD format.

### E022 - Sequential `stop_time_update` times are not increasing

`stop_time_update` arrival/departure times between sequential stops should always increase - they should never be the same or decrease.

#### References:
* [Stop Time Updates description](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates)

<a name="E023"/>

### E023 - trip `start_time` does not match first GTFS `arrival_time`

For normal scheduled trips (i.e., not defined in `frequencies.txt`), the GTFS-realtime trip `start_time` must match the first GTFS `arrival_time` in `stop_times.txt` for this trip.

From [`trip.start_time`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor):

>`start_time` - The initially scheduled start time of this trip instance. When the trip_id corresponds to a non-frequency-based trip, this field should either be omitted or be equal to the value in the GTFS feed.

*Common mistakes* - Accidentally providing a GTFS-realtime time that is modulo 24hr, such as `00:02:00`, when that trip start time in GTFS `stop_times.txt` is after midnight of the service day, such as `24:02:00`  

*Possible solution* - Make sure that any `start_times` in GTFS-realtime match that same trip start time in GTFS `stop_times.txt`, especially if the trip starts after midnight of the service day.

### E024 - trip `direction_id` does not match GTFS data

GTFS-rt trip `direction_id` must match the `direction_id` in GTFS `trips.txt`.

From [`trip.direction_id`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#message-tripdescriptor):

>`direction_id` - The direction_id from the GTFS feed trips.txt file, indicating the direction of travel for trips this selector refers to.

<a name="E025"/>

### E025 - `stop_time_update` departure time is before arrival time

Within the same `stop_time_update`, arrival and departures times can be the same, or the departure time can be later than the arrival time - the departure time should never come before the arrival time.

Vehicle bearing must be between 0 and 360 degrees (inclusive).  The GTFS-rt spec says bearing is:

>...in degrees, clockwise from True North, i.e., 0 is North and 90 is East. This can be the compass bearing, or the direction towards the next stop or intermediate location. This should not be deduced from the sequence of previous positions, which clients can compute from previous data.

### E028 - Vehicle `position` outside agency coverage area

The vehicle `position` should be inside the agency coverage area.  Coverage area is defined by a buffer surrounding the GTFS `shapes.txt` data, or `stops.txt` locations if the GTFS feed doesn't include `shapes.txt`.

Buffer distance is defined by `GtfsMetadata.REGION_BUFFER_METERS`, and is currently 1609 meters (roughly 1 mile).

### E029 - Vehicle `position` far from trip shape

The vehicle `position` should be within a buffer surrounding the GTFS `shapes.txt` data for the current trip unless there is an `alert` with the `effect` of `DETOUR` for this `trip_id`.

Buffer distance is defined by `GtfsMetadata.TRIP_BUFFER_METERS`, and is currently 200 meters (roughly 1/8 of a mile).

### E036 - Sequential `stop_time_updates` have the same `stop_sequence`

Sequential GTFS-rt trip `stop_time_updates` should never have the same `stop_sequence` - `stop_sequence` must increase for each `stop_time_update`.

From [GTFS `stop_times.txt`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/reference.md#stop_timestxt):

>The values for stop_sequence must be non-negative integers, and they must increase along the trip.

### E037 - Sequential `stop_time_updates` have the same `stop_id`

Sequential GTFS-rt trip `stop_time_updates` shouldn't have the same `stop_id` - sequential `stop_ids` should be different.  If a `stop_id` is visited more than once in a trip (i.e., a loop), and if no `stop_time_updates` in the loop are provided in the feed, and if the `stop_sequence` field of the stop where the loop starts/stops is provided in the GTFS-rt feed for the given `stop_id`, then this may not be an error.

If the `stop_time_update.schedule_relationship` is not `SKIPPED`, `stop_time_update.arrival` and `stop_time_update.departure` must have either `delay` or `time` - both fields cannot be missing.

[Stop Time Updates description](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/trip-updates.md#stop-time-updates) says:

>The update can provide a exact timing for arrival and/or departure at a stop in StopTimeUpdates using StopTimeEvent. This should contain either an absolute time or a delay (i.e. an offset from the scheduled time in seconds).

[`stop_time_update.schedule_relationship`](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs-realtime/spec/en/reference.md#enum-schedulerelationship) says:

### E046 - GTFS-rt `stop_time_update` without `time` doesn't have arrival/departure_time in GTFS

If only `delay` is provided in a `stop_time_update` `arrival` or `departure` (and not a `time`), then the GTFS `stop_times.txt` must contain arrival_times and/or departure_times for these corresponding stops.  A `delay` value in the real-time feed is meaningless unless you have a clock time to add it to in the GTFS `stop_times.txt` file.

*Common mistakes* - Providing a `arrival/departure.delay` value, but not providing a `arrival/departure.time` value for non-timepoint stops that do not have an `arrival_time` or `departure_time` in GTFS `stop_times.txt`.  

*Possible solution* - Add a `time` value to the GTFS-rt feed for the `arrival` and `departure`, or add an `arrival_time` and `departure_time` in `GTFS stop_times.txt`.

### E047 - `VehiclePosition` and `TripUpdate` ID pairing mismatch

If separate `VehiclePositions` and `TripUpdates` feeds are provided, `VehicleDescriptor` or `TripDescriptor` ID value pairing should match between the two feeds.  

In other words, if the `VehiclePosition` has a `vehicle_id` A that is assigned to `trip_id` 4, then the `TripUpdate` feed should have a prediction for `trip_id` 4 that includes a reference to `vehicle_id` A.  If the `trip_id` of 4 is paired with a different `vehicle_id` B in one of the two feeds, this is an error.

Note that this is different from W003, which simply checks to see if an ID that is provided in one feed is provided in the other - that is a warning.

>This timestamp identifies the moment when the content of this feed has been created (in server time). In POSIX time (i.e., number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC). To avoid time skew between systems producing and consuming realtime information it is strongly advised to derive timestamp from a time server. It is completely acceptable to use Stratum 3 or even lower strata servers since time differences up to a couple of seconds are tolerable.

Timestamps are flagged as being in the future if they greater than the current time plus `TimestampValidator.MAX_IN_FUTURE_SECONDS`, which is currently set to 60 seconds.

### E051 - GTFS-rt `stop_sequence` not found in GTFS data

All `stop_time_update` `stop_sequences` in GTFS-realtime data must appear in GTFS `stop_times.txt` for that trip.

To keep GTFS-rt validator runtime performance at O(n) for GTFS stop_times.txt (i.e., so we don't have to loop through the entire GTFS stop_times.txt for each GTFS-rt stop_time_update, which would be O(n*m)), if E051 is logged for a `stop_time_update`, subsequent `stop_time_updates` in that same GTFS-rt trip will not be checked for other errors or warnings (e.g., [E046 - GTFS-rt `stop_time_update` without `time` doesn't have arrival/departure_time in GTFS](https://github.com/CUTR-at-USF/gtfs-realtime-validator/blob/master/RULES.md#E046)).

### W001 - `timestamp` not populated

`timestamps` should be populated for `FeedHeader`, `TripUpdates`, `VehiclePositions`, and `Alerts`.  

Including `timestamps` for each entity type enhances the transit rider experience, as consumers can show `timestamp` information to end users give them an idea of how old certain information is.  

For example, when a vehicle position is shown on a map, the marker may say "Data updated 17 sec ago" (see screenshot below).  If vehicle position `timestamps` aren't included, then the consumer must use the GTFS-rt header `timestamp`, which may be much more recent than the actual vehicle position, resulting in misleading information being show to end users.

### W002 - `vehicle_id` not populated

`vehicle_id` should be populated for TripUpdates and VehiclePositions.  

Populating `vehicle_ids` in TripUpdates is important so consumers can relate a given arrival/departure prediction to a particular vehicle.

<a name="W003"/>

### W003 - ID in one feed missing from the other

If separate `VehiclePositions` and `TripUpdates` feeds are provided, a `trip_id` that is provided in the `VehiclePositions` feed should be provided in the `TripUpdates` feed, and a vehicle_id that is provided in the `TripUpdates` feed should be provided in the `VehiclePositions` feed.

In other words, if the `VehiclePosition` has a vehicle that is assigned to `trip_id` 4, then the `TripUpdate` feed should have a prediction for `trip_id` 4.

Note that this is different from E047, which checks for a mismatch of IDs between the feeds - that is an error.

### W004 - vehicle `speed` is unrealistic

`vehicle.position.speed` has an unrealistic speed that may be incorrect.  

Speeds are flagged as unrealistic if they are greater than `VehicleValidator.MAX_REALISTIC_SPEED_METERS_PER_SECOND`, which is currently set to 26 meters per second (approx. 60 miles per hour). 

*Common mistakes* - Accidentally setting the speed value in *miles per hour*, instead of *meters per second*.
